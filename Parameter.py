Purpose :

    Parameter class for Latin Hypercube Sample. Consists of three variables:
    name, lower and high sampling intervals. Includes sampling method.

Usage :

    alpha = Parameter('alpha', low=0.1, high=2)
    alpha.sample(10)
    
    Draws 10 samples from bounds.

Observations :

    Divides interval into 10 pieces, drawing from each piece at a time to
    ensure uniform coverage.
